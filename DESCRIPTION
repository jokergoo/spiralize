Description: It visualizes data along an Archimedean spiral <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral>. 
    It has two major advantages for visualization: 1. It is able to visualize data with very long axis with high 
    resolution. 2. It is efficient for time series data to reveal periodic patterns.
