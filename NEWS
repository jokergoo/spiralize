- `spiral_initialize_by_time()`: radical lines are calculated in a way that they correspond to the proportion of month days in a year.
- `spiral_initialize()`: `polar_lines_by` now accepts a vector which defines where to draw polar lines.
- `spiral_initialize()`: add `clockwise` argument.

- `xscale` and `yscale` are now correctly calculated for the spiral viewport.

## version 1.0.3
